# Mimesis_Tool
A Python-based Alteryx tool for generating sample data

This tool uses the Python package [Mimesis](https://mimesis.readthedocs.io/) to generate dummy data for testing purposes. The tool has an optional input, so users can either create a completely new data source or append dummy data to existing fields. There is also Locale option that will generate data that is appropriate for the language or country associated with that locale.
